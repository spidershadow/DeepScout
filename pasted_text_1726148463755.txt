Renewable Energy Overview
The Renewable Energy sector focuses on generating energy from sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat. The sector aims to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the environmental impact of energy production. Renewable energy sources offer a clean, sustainable, and increasingly cost-competitive alternative to traditional energy sources.

Sub-sectors
Five sub-sectors of the Renewable Energy sector with brief descriptions:

1. Solar Energy: This sub-sector harnesses the energy from the sun to generate electricity through photovoltaic (PV) panels or concentrate solar power (CSP) systems. Solar energy is widely used for residential, commercial, and utility-scale applications.

2. Wind Energy: Wind power utilizes wind turbines to convert the kinetic energy of moving air into electricity. Onshore and offshore wind farms are increasingly common, providing a significant share of electricity in many countries.

3. Hydropower: Hydropower generates electricity by harnessing the energy of flowing or falling water. It includes large-scale hydroelectric dams and small-scale run-of-river systems. Hydropower is one of the most mature and widely used renewable energy sources.

4. Geothermal Energy: This sub-sector utilizes the heat from the Earth's core to generate electricity or provide direct heating. Geothermal power plants use hot water and steam from underground reservoirs to drive turbines and generate electricity.

5. Bioenergy: Bioenergy encompasses various forms of energy derived from biomass, such as wood, agricultural crops, and organic waste. It includes technologies like biomass combustion, biogas production (from anaerobic digestion), and biofuels (like ethanol and biodiesel) for transportation.
