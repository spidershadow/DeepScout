Biotechnology
Biotechnology Overview
The biotechnology sector involves the use of living organisms, biological systems, or their derivatives to develop products and technologies that benefit various industries, including healthcare, agriculture, and environmental science. Biotechnology combines knowledge from multiple disciplines, such as biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering, to create innovative solutions to complex problems.

Sub-sectors
Here are five sub-sectors of biotechnology with brief descriptions:

1. Biopharmaceuticals: This sub-sector focuses on developing and manufacturing drugs and therapies using living organisms or their products. Examples include recombinant proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and gene therapies for treating diseases like cancer, autoimmune disorders, and genetic conditions.

2. Agricultural Biotechnology: Also known as agritech, this sub-sector applies biotechnology to improve crop yields, enhance plant traits, and develop more sustainable farming practices. Examples include genetically modified crops resistant to pests or herbicides, as well as the use of biofertilizers and biopesticides.

3. Industrial Biotechnology: This sub-sector utilizes biological systems to create or optimize industrial processes and products. Applications include the production of enzymes, biofuels, and bio-based chemicals, as well as the use of microorganisms for bioremediation and waste treatment.

4. Genomics and Molecular Diagnostics: This sub-sector involves the study and application of genetic information for various purposes, such as personalized medicine, disease diagnosis, and drug development. Examples include genetic testing, DNA sequencing, and the development of biomarkers for disease prediction and monitoring.

5. Regenerative Medicine and Tissue Engineering: This sub-sector focuses on developing therapies that regenerate, replace, or repair damaged tissues and organs. Examples include stem cell therapies, tissue scaffolds, and 3D bioprinting for creating functional tissues and organs for transplantation or research purposes.
